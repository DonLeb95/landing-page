# Landing Page

This project was done with the intention of applying CSS concepts ive learned so far in conjunction with html structuring.

Its a reference of a landing page with provided properties. The main goal was practicing positioning of elements mainly using flexbox and getting a feel for doing a project from scratch, while searching for additional resources/concepts to learn and apply.

The references are 
*   ![landing-page] (references/01.png)
*   ![properties] (references/02.png)
